# MeshInfo-Lite

Realtime web UI to run against a Meshtastic regional or private mesh network. 

A work in progress. This is a customized for [CSRA Mesh](https://www.csramesh.org/) but probably still has references to the projects and meshes that it was forked from (originally forked from [agessaman/meshinfo-lite](https://github.com/agessaman/meshinfo-lite)).

## Overview

MeshInfo-Lite is a highly customized version of [MeshInfo](https://github.com/MeshAddicts/meshinfo) written in Python and connects to an MQTT server that is receiving Meshtastic messages for the purpose of visualizing and inspecting traffic. It uses MariaDB to persist content.

To make deployment to run an instance for your mesh easy, Docker support is included. We recommend using Docker Compose with a personalized version of the `docker-compose.yml` file to most easily deploy it, but any seasoned Docker user can also use the Docker image alone.

If you use MeshInfoLite and have a publicly accessible instance, we'd like to know! Drop a note to dade@dade.co.za with details and we'll link it below.

See an example instance running on the [South African Mesh](https://mesh.zr1rf.za.net).

If you are running a high elevation node, preferrably a `Router` or `Repeater` node, you might be interested in getting on the notification list for a [cavity filter](https://shop.airframes.io/products/lora-915mhz-filter) that Kevin and Trevor are having made.

If you're interested in aeronautical (ADS-B/ACARS/VDL/HFDL/SATCOM) or ship tracking (AIS), please take a look at sister project [Airframes](https://airframes.io) / [Airframes Github](https://github.com/airframesio).

## Running

### Docker Compose (preferred for 24/7 servers)

#### Setup

##### Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/roperscrossroads/meshinfo-lite.git
cd meshinfo-lite
```

##### Edit Configuration

1. Copy and then edit the `config.ini.sample` to `config.ini`. 
      
#### To Run

Change to the directory.

```sh
cd meshinfo-lite
```

```sh
docker compose pull && docker compose down && docker compose up -d && docker compose ps && docker compose logs -f meshinfo
```

#### To Update

```sh
git fetch && git pull && docker compose pull && docker compose down && docker compose up -d && docker compose ps && docker compose logs -f meshinfo
```

### Directly (without Docker)

Be sure you have `Python 3.12.4` or higher installed.

Install MariaDB and create the database and user permissions
```
sudo mysql -u root
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS meshdata;
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'meshdata'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'passw0rd';
GRANT ALL ON meshdata.* TO 'meshdata'@'localhost';
ALTER DATABASE meshdata CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
COMMIT;
```


```sh
python -m venv .
. bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Development

### Building a local Docker image

Clone the repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/roperscrossroads/meshinfo-lite.git
```

If already existing, be sure to pull updates.

```sh
git fetch && git pull
```

Build. Be sure to specify a related version number and suffix (this example `dev5` but could be your name or initials and a number) as this will help prevent collisions in your local image cache when testing.

```sh
scripts/docker-build.sh 0.0.1dev5
```

### Running via Docker Compose while developing

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up --build --force-recreate
```

You will need to CTRL-C and run again if you make any changes to the python code, but not if you only make changes to
the templates.

## Meshtastic node settings

These are the settings that must be set, and how they must be set on your node if you would like it to show up on the map. Anything that is not preceded by "Recommended" must be set as stated for your node to show.

```
Channels > Click on LongFast
	Uplink Enabled: True
	Downlink Enabled: Recommended False
	Position Enabled: True
	Precise Location: False
	Bottom slider: 1194ft is the *most* accurate setting that will still show up on any map. This is a meshtastic limitation.
	
	Be sure to click send to save after each page/section

Position: 
	
	Set your lat/long/alt and set "Used fixed position" to True if your node doesn't have GPS or is stationary
	
	Otherwise set your GPS settings.
	
Lora: 
	OK to MQTT: True
	
MQTT:
	Address: mqtt.meshtastic.org
	Username: meshdev
	Password: large4cats
	
	Encryption enabled: True
	JSON output enabled: False

	Root topic: msh/US/FL/anything
 (Typical options to replace 'anything' above are: orl, jax, etc...As long as your root topic starts with msh/US/FL then you're good.)

	Proxy to client enabled: True if your board isn't directly hooked to Wi-Fi or Ethernet.
	Map reporting: True
	Precise location: False
	
	Slider at the bottom: 1194 feet is the *most* accurate you can set things to and still have your node show up on maps.
	
	Map reporting interval: 900
```
